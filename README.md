## pastez Challenge

The easiest way to play like you were in the DEF CON 31 CTF finals: start a stopwatch and open the `handout/` folder and stop the clock when you exploit the binary and pop a shell.

If you'd rather build the challenge from scratch, check out [build_from_scratch.sh](./build_from_scratch.sh) (requires docker) which clones and builds from the [official repo](https://github.com/Live-CTF/LiveCTF-DEFCON31).
The steps are the same to build any challenge from the finals.

Best time from the competition for solving `pastez` was 15 minutes 33 seconds by [Norsecode](https://norsecode.team/).

Good luck!

My manual timestamp notes from the Match 13 streams are in [timestamps dir](./timestamps/).

They should be within 1 second of actual and gloss over some very minor details, but please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seeinglogic) if you find something that seems really off.
