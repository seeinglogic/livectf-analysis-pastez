## pastez Challenge

The easiest way to play like you were in the DEF CON 31 CTF finals: start a stopwatch and open the `handout/` folder.

If you'd rather build it from scratch, check out `build_from_scratch.sh` (requires docker) which clones and builds from the [official repo](https://github.com/Live-CTF/LiveCTF-DEFCON31).

Best time from the competition was 15 minutes 33 seconds by [Norsecode](https://norsecode.team/).

Good luck!

My manual timestamp notes from the Match 13 streams are in [timestamps dir](./timestamps/).

They should be within 1 second of actual and gloss over some very minor details, but please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seeinglogic) if you find something that seems really off.
